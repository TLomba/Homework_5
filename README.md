// # 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

// This is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

// I used the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.

// ## User Story

// `// AS AN employee with a busy schedule // I WANT to add important events to a daily planner // SO THAT I can manage my time effectively //`

// ## Acceptance Criteria

// `// GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule // WHEN I open the planner // THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar // WHEN I scroll down // THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours // WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day // THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future // WHEN I click into a timeblock // ----------- text block created in block // THEN I can enter an event // WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock atrribute same index as block //------------store local // THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage // WHEN I refresh the page // THEN the saved events persist //`
